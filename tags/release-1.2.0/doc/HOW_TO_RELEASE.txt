How To release a new version of GuiceBerry
==========================================

1) Create a release SVN tag:

$ svn cp trunk tags/release-x.y.z

2) Edit this tag's build.properties, changing the 'version=snapshot' line to

version=x.y.z

3) Build a dist

$ ant clean test dist

4) Commit:

$ svn commit -m "release x.y.z"

5) Create a tar of the release itself

$ svn export . build/dist/guiceberry-release-x.y.z
$ cd build/dist
$ zip -r guiceberry-release-x.y.z.zip guiceberry-release-x.y.z

5) Upload jars to GoogleCode

The URL is http://code.google.com/p/guiceberry/downloads/list > New Download. Upload these files, in this order:

build/dist/guiceberry-release-x.y.z.zip
Summary: Full source code
Labels: Type-Source

build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z/guiceberry-x.y.z-src.jar
Summary: source
Labels: Type-Source, OpSys-All

build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z/guiceberry-x.y.z-tutorial.jar

Labels: Type-Docs, OpSys-All

build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z/guiceberry-x.y.z.jar

Delete the older release, and also, make sure to check the installation instructions at http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dddf9mmq_2sjv9nkk4 particularly if you changed the version of a dependent lib.
