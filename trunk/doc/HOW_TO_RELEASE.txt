How To release a new version of GuiceBerry (either read this or run howtorelease.sh for instructions)
==========================================

If you, say, upgraded libs, change the tutorial docs.

0) Before you begin, make sure it's all committed and you have no compilation/test errors:

$ svn update
$ svn status
$ ant clean test dist

1) Create a release SVN tag:

$ svn cp trunk tags/release-x.y.z

2) go to that directory:

$ cd tags/release-x.y.z

3) Edit this tag's build.properties, changing the 'version=snapshot' line to

version=x.y.z

4) Build a dist

$ ant clean test dist

5) Commit:

$ svn commit -m "release x.y.z"

6) Create a tar of the release itself

$ svn export . build/dist/guiceberry-release-x.y.z; cd build/dist; zip -r guiceberry-release-x.y.z.zip guiceberry-release-x.y.z

7) Upload jars to GoogleCode

The URL is http://code.google.com/p/guiceberry/downloads/list > New Download. Upload these files:

build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z/guiceberry-x.y.z-javadoc.jar

Mark the older release as deprecated (which you'll find as an option under "Delete"), and also, make sure to check the installation instructions at http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dddf9mmq_2sjv9nkk4 particularly if you changed the version of a dependent lib.
