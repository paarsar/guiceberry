How To release a new version of GuiceBerry (either read this or run howtorelease.sh for instructions)
==========================================

If you, say, upgraded libs, change the tutorial docs.

Before you begin, make sure it's all committed and you have no compilation/test errors:

$ svn update && svn status
$ ant clean test dist

Then, run this:

$ echo -e "\n\n*** Creating a release SVN tag and switching to it" && \
  cd .. && svn cp trunk tags/release-x.y.z && cd tags/release-x.y.z && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Changing this tag's build.properties (changing 'version=snapshot' to 'version=x.y.z')" && \
  sed s/version=snapshot/version=x.y.z/ build.properties > tmp && mv tmp build.properties && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Building a dist" && \
  ant clean test dist && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Committing" && \
  svn commit -m "release x.y.z" && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Creating a tar of the release itself" && \
  svn export . build/dist/guiceberry-release-x.y.z && cd build/dist && zip -r guiceberry-x.y.z/guiceberry-release-x.y.z.zip guiceberry-release-x.y.z && cd -

Finally, upload the jars to GoogleCode. The URL is http://code.google.com/p/guiceberry/downloads/list > New Download. Upload these files (all of them from the build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z directory):

Mark the older release as deprecated (which you'll find as an option under "Delete"), and also, make sure to check the installation instructions at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cyism50KXTMXcvYNbqUXi3gaaNKaXDgjXjpx4rPNet8/edit particularly if you changed the version of a dependent lib.
